**How you designed your program for Package sending and processing**  
client:  
  main:  
    create socket  
    connect socket to server  
    open directory  
    while(directory has entry):  
      enqueue png entry to queue  
    while(1):
      open image file  
      dequeue request  
      populate packet fields with request information  
      serialize metadata and send to clientHandler  
      if IMG_OP_NAK was received:  
        skip to next image  
      call send_file  
      call receive_file  
    send IMG_OP_EXIT to client handling thread  
    close socket  
    
  send_file:  
      open files and set up buffers
      while(image data left to send)
        read image data into buffer
        send to clientHandler  
        receive acknowledge packet from clientHandler

    
  receive_file:  
    open file in output directory   
    while(image data left to receive)
      receive processed image data from clientHandler
      write the data to opened file  
      send back acknowledge packet
    
server:  
  main:  
    create sockets for listening and connecting  
    bind listening socket   
    listen on the socket  
    while(1):  
      accept connection from client for connecting socket  
      create handling thread that will call clientHandler  
      detach thread  
  
  clientHandler:  
    while(1):  
      receive metadata packet from client  
      deserialize packet  
      if IMG_OP_EXIT is received:  
        break
      send acknowledgment packet to client
      while(image data left to receive)
        receive image data and write into tempfile
        send back ack packet to client
        if any errors are encountered:  
          send IMG_OP_NAK and skip rest of job
      process image data and write into new rotated file
      while(image data left to send)
        read image data into buffer
        send to client
        receive acknowledge packet from client
    clean up and kill thread
